   - Identify usage patterns and traffic sources
   - Highlight most active clients

2. üîí **Security Threat Detection**
   - Monitor failed login attempts
   - Flag potentially malicious IP addresses
   - Early warning system for potential security risks

3. üìà **Flexible Reporting**
   - Console summary output
   - Comprehensive CSV report generation
   - Easy data visualization and further analysis

## Prerequisites

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external library dependencies
- Web server log file in standard format

### Supported Log Formats
- Compatible with standard web server log formats
